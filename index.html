        I don't know what's going on right now, but I feel so down.
        I don't want to talk to anyone; 
        day by day everything feels like a storm for me.
       <br>
        I just want to talk to you. Your thoughts are stuck in my mind. I don't even know what I did all day. Right now, my emotions get heavier on me. It feels like I lost something so precious 🥺 thing.
I also know that everything I do is a headache for you, but I didn't do that intentionally.
